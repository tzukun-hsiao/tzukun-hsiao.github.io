In the fall of 2022, I co-instructed IS445 Data Visualization with Professor Matthew Turk. The course provides an overview of the concepts and tools for constructing data-driven visualizations, with the goal of acquainting students with the principles of creating communicative visualizations and developing the skills to work with data and create visualizations.

My teaching covered topics such as data types, data manipulation, and tools for creating interactive visualizations. In the lectures, I introduced fundamental concepts and demonstrated their applications through live-coding activities. These activities showed how to create interactive plots that allow users to explore the data, as well as how to link multiple plots to present different views of the same data.
