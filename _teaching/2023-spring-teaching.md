In 2021, I began developing IS597-RIO Research Impact with Professor Jodi Schneider, and I later co-instructed the course in the spring of 2023. The course is designed to acquaint students with the theories, concepts, methods, applications, and limitations of bibliometrics in research impact evaluation. The course is open to students from any research field and accommodates varying levels of data-analytic skills.

I developed lectures that address where to collect data for impact evaluation, what aspects of impact can be (or are difficult to be) evaluated, and how to conduct evaluations. My lectures not only introduced key concepts and methods for evaluating research impact but also incorporated real-world examples to demonstrate the practical applications.

To provide students with hands-on experience, I designed and led three in-class lab sessions. The first session guided students through the process of cleaning and analyzing bibliographic data. In this lab session, I also showed how data decisions could influence analysis outcomes. The second and third sessions focused on the skills for building a research profile and identifying topics within a set of articles using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
