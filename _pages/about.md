I am a Ph.D. candidate in Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I study knowledge diffusion through descriptions of prior research in scientific articles. By combining bibliometrics, natural language processing techniques, and data-driven analysis, I investigate how and why prior research is mentioned in scientific articles, particularly through citations and their surrounding text (i.e., citation contexts).

In addition to this primary line of research, I am also interested in:
- Building tools for parsing scientific articles
- Quality issues in large-scale scholarly datasets
